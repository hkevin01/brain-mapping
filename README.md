## Project Overview
A GPU-accelerated, open-source toolkit for brain imaging data (fMRI, DTI) visualization and analysis. Designed to democratize access to advanced brain mapping tools for researchers and clinicians.

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 3 In Progress (July 2025)

- **Phase 1 & 2:** Complete and fully validated
- **Phase 3:** Advanced features (BIDS, cloud, ML workflows, real-time, multi-modal) in progress
- **New CI jobs:** BIDS validation, cloud integration, ML workflow, real-time analysis, and multi-modal integration now tested on all platforms
- **Modular code review and refactor:** Ongoing for maintainability and best practices
- **See:** [Suggestions & Continuous Improvement](docs/project-plan.md#-suggestions--continuous-improvement)

---

> **Note:**
> New integrations and future phases are being planned, including open data (Zenodo, OSF), security (Snyk), Jupyter/Binder demos, and community channels (Discord). See the [project plan](docs/project-plan.md) for details and checkboxes.

## âœ… Highlights

### Mixed-Precision GPU Smoothing
- CPU (NumPy, float32) and GPU (CuPy, float32/float16)
- ROCm/CuPy backend for AMD GPUs
- Dramatic speedup for large neuroimaging datasets

### BIDS Dataset Compatibility
- Automatic detection and validation of BIDS datasets
- Loading of subject/session/task NIfTI files
- Clear error messages for non-compliance
- **Continuous CI validation across platforms**

### Plugin Architecture
- Extensible preprocessing pipelines with custom plugins
- Built-in plugins: Gaussian smoothing, quality control, motion correction

### Cloud Integration
- AWS/Google Cloud/Azure support for data and pipelines
- Secure data sharing and collaboration
- **Automated CI tests for cloud integration**

### ML Workflow
- Automated analysis, custom training, and model interpretation
- **Continuous CI validation for ML workflows**

### Real-Time Analysis
- Streaming, buffer management, and live visualization
- **Continuous CI validation for real-time analysis**

### Multi-Modal Integration
- EEG/MEG data loading, synchronization, and cross-modal analysis
- **Continuous CI validation for multi-modal integration**

### Modular Code Review & Visualization
- Ongoing review and refactor for maintainability, efficiency, and best practices
- Visualization modules (`renderer_3d`, `glass_brain`) are now modularized with shared utilities and new tests.
- **Current Focus**: Modularizing `multi_planar.py`.
- See progress in [project plan](docs/project-plan.md#-suggestions--continuous-improvement)

---

## Current Focus
- High-performance, standards-based data loading
- GPU-accelerated preprocessing (ROCm/CuPy, mixed-precision)
- Modular code review and maintainability improvements
- Building a robust foundation for advanced analytics and visualization

---

## Installation
See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for dependencies. For ROCm/CuPy support, follow the [CuPy ROCm install guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy-for-rocm).

---

## Roadmap
- [x] Core data loading and preprocessing
- [x] GPU-accelerated smoothing (ROCm/CuPy)
- [x] BIDS dataset compatibility
- [x] Plugin architecture for extensible pipelines
- [x] Community and research lab onboarding
- [x] Modular code review and refactor (complete)
- [x] Modular visualization and glass brain utilities (complete)

## Modular Visualization & Glass Brain Utilities
Visualization modules are now modularized with shared utilities and new tests. Glass brain projections and overlays are easier to use and extend. See the [visualization directory](src/brain_mapping/visualization/) for details.

---

## Node.js & Frontend Tooling
This project now includes a minimal `package.json` for documentation and frontend tooling (Prettier, docs build/serve scripts). See the file for details and future expansion.

---

## Suggestions & Continuous Improvement
See the [project plan Suggestions & Continuous Improvement section](docs/project-plan.md#-suggestions--continuous-improvement) for actionable checklists and ongoing improvements.

---

## Logs & Traceability
- All code, test, and documentation changes are logged in `logs/CHANGELOG_AUTOMATED.md`.
- Test outputs are saved in the `logs/` directory for traceability.
