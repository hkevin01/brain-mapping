## Outstanding Test Tasks
### Latest Test Run (2025-07-21 03:31)
- 33 tests collected: 30 passed, 3 skipped (visualization/VTK not available)
- All tests pass. Suite remains fully green and traceable. New visualization tests for `multi_planar` and `glass_brain` are present and passing (or skipped if VTK is unavailable).
- Next: Continue expanding tests for new features and maintain 100% pass rate.
- [x] Add/expand tests for BIDS loader and validation
- [x] Add/expand tests for cloud processor and collaboration
- [x] Add/expand tests for ML workflow (training, prediction, interpretation)
- [x] Add/expand tests for real-time and multi-modal modules
- [x] Add/expand integration tests (end-to-end workflows)
