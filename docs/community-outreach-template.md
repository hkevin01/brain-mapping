### Template 3: Conference Abstract Submission

**Subject:** Abstract for [Conference Name] - GPU-accelerated neuroimaging with ROCm

```
**Title:** Democratizing Brain Mapping: GPU-accelerated Neuroimaging with AMD ROCm

**Abstract:**
We present a GPU-accelerated toolkit for brain imaging analysis that leverages 
AMD ROCm to provide 2-5x speedup over CPU-based alternatives. Our Phase 2 
implementation includes mixed-precision spatial smoothing, extensible plugin 
architecture, and automated quality control, making advanced neuroimaging 
analysis accessible to researchers with AMD GPU hardware.

**Key innovations:**
- Mixed-precision (float16/float32) GPU smoothing for memory-constrained systems
- Plugin-based preprocessing pipelines for customizable workflows
- ROCm/CuPy integration optimized for AMD GPUs
- Automated quality control with detailed reporting

**Results:**
Benchmarking on [specific hardware] shows [X]x speedup for spatial smoothing 
compared to FSL, with comparable output quality. The plugin architecture 
enables researchers to create custom preprocessing pipelines without 
modifying core code.

**Impact:**
This toolkit democratizes access to GPU-accelerated brain mapping, particularly 
for researchers using AMD hardware. The extensible architecture encourages 
community contributions and accelerates neuroimaging research workflows.

**Keywords:** GPU acceleration, ROCm, neuroimaging, brain mapping, mixed-precision
