# Brain Mapping Toolkit Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan documents the strategy, coverage, and progress for all major features, including provenance tracking, workflow modules, and CI/CD validation.

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all core modules (bids_loader, preprocessor, data_loader, fsl_integration)
- Integration tests for provenance event logging in all workflows
- CI/CD jobs for test, lint, build, validation, and provenance
- All test outputs saved in logs/ for traceability

## Progress Log
- Provenance integration tests implemented and run in CI
- All major modules have corresponding unit and integration tests
- Test output and provenance logs uploaded as CI artifacts
- Next: Review logs and refine tests based on feedback

## Future Improvements
- Expand test cases for edge scenarios and error handling
- Add property-based and fuzz testing for robustness
- Enhance test documentation and reporting
